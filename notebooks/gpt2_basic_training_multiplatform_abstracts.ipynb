Poor and Hispanic women were more likely to receive a chest wall boost than were more affluent and non-Hispanic women. INTRODUCTION: Healthcare disparities in breast cancer treatment have been well documented. We investigated the socioeconomic status (SES) and racial factors in women with locally advanced breast cancer from the California Cancer Registry who had received postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) with or without a chest wall boost (CWB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 4747 women with invasive breast cancer, diagnosed from 2005 to 2009, who had undergone PMRT, were reviewed and stratified by treatment with (n = 2686 [57%]) or without (n = 2061 [43%]) a CWB. Various patient demographic and biologic factors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Receipt of a CWB was associated with race/ethnicity (P < .001), SES (P < .001), tumor size (P = .038), tumor grade (P = .033), human ep\n","Show val_loader first entry (converted to text):\n","ubtype, tumor size >2 cm, intermediate- and high-grade, positive ER status, positive Her2 status, angio-invasion, and the presence/extent of a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) component. In multivariate logistic regression, the variables with the strongest association with involved margins (OR > 2) were multifocality, lobular subtype, large tumor size, and the presence of DCIS. CONCLUSIONS: Several clinicopathologic features are associated with involved resection margins after BCS for IBC. Assessment of these features preoperatively could be used to optimize preoperative counseling. BYL719, which selectively inhibits the alpha isoform of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit (p110a), is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors, especially luminal breast cancers with PIK3CA mutations and/or HER2 amplification. This study reveals that, even among these sensitive cancers, the initial efficacy of p110alpha inhibition is mitigated by rapid re-accumulation of the PI3K product PIP3 produced by the p110beta isoform.

Experiment 1b: try alternate text\n","There are two rationales for this, one for this current work and one looking forward.\n","1. For this current work, it is interesting to see if different corpora perform significantly differently. Both are open source short stories (or part of a short story, truncated to be similar length to the first, for the second). This is just a basic check to see if reasonably similar sources vary much. Note also the concern that the test set is simply the last part of each story; this could easily have different characteristics than the rest of the text. Visual inspection doesn't reveal anything crazy (like if the last part were an author's note with different words and style than earlier) - but this could obviously be quantified by looking at word frequency or ngram frequency, etc. Simply comparing loss curves (both training and validation) for these two stories allows a quick and dirty examination of the effect of source material, when the source material is similar.\n","\n","2. Longer run: rationale for this is that there is a concern that \"the-verdict\" text may have been part of the training set of GPT2. I found an \"open source\" text that is from ~2024/2025, so should not have been part of the ~2019 training of GPT2. This is not an issue here with training from scratch, but for continued pre-training and evaluation, it is. So the test here is to see if this alterate text performs similarly, so I can use it with continued pre-training experiments in the GPT2-small framework.  \n","\n","3. I expect minor some minor differences; these texts are sylistically quite different in many ways, which can affect training.  \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1c3ee1d0","metadata":{"id":"1c3ee1d0"},"outputs":[],"source":["cfg2['run_name']=\"gpt2_basic_exp_1b\"\n","cfg2['description']=\"gpt2 with the adjusted watch story\"\n","# \"training_file\": \"/home/markb/llm-from-scratch/data/the-verdict.txt\"\n","cfg2['training_file'] = PROJECT_ROOT +  \"/data/The-watch-story-adj-smaller-2.txt\"\n","run_training(cfg2)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"837ec5f1","metadata":{"id":"837ec5f1"},"source":["### RESULTS  \n","1.
